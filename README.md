# ChaosInTheOldWorld

My own project to make digital version of Chaos In The Old World board game as an online client/server set. There will be four parts:

1) Creating general interface

2) Including Chaos database into created interface

3) Creating playable bots

4) Creating client-server interface


Two last parts will be completely parallel.
