# ChaosInTheOldWorld

My own project to make digital version of Chaos In The Old World board game as an online client/server set. There will be four parts:

1) Creating general interface
2) Including Chaos database into created interface
3) Creating playable bots
4) Creating client-server interface

The two last parts will be completely parallel.
